# Don't modify directly on this file!

# TODO: Finish following 3 questions. Everyone in team should work on at least one question. It's ok to have multiple solutions for same question (for team with members more than 3).

# Acceptable Condition (AC):
#   - A repo on GitHub with 3 solution files and this file.
#   - File name should be function_name.py (e.g. is_anagram.py)
#   - If there are multiple solution for a question, name file as function_name_1.py (e.g. is_anagram_1.py)


# Question 1
# When read string 's' backward, if it's same as read it forward, then we say 's' is a palindrome. e.g. "racecar" reading backward is still "racecar".
# Assume letters in 's' will always be lower case.
# Return if 's' is a palindrome
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    :type s: str
    :rtype: bool
    """
    pass


# Question 2
# By re-arrange letter in 's', if we can get 't', then we say 's' & 't' is anagram to each other. e.g. "listen" and "silent" are anagrams to each other.
# Assume letters in 's' & 't' will always be lower case.
# Return if 's' & 't' are anagrams to each other
def is_anagram(s, t):

# Question 3
# Return if 'num' is a prime number

    :type num: int
